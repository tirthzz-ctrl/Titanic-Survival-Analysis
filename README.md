# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using Machine Learning.  
It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and an optional user interface (UX) for predictions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The Titanic dataset is a classic binary classification problem.  
The goal is to predict **Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)** based on passenger details such as age, gender, class, fare, and family information.

This project demonstrates:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Machine Learning Model Training
- Model Evaluation
- Practical UX integration (optional)

---

## 🧠 Features Used

### Original Features
- Pclass
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- SibSp
- Parch
- Embarked

### Engineered Features
- **FamilySize** = SibSp + Parch + 1  
- **IsAlone** (travelling alone or not)
- **Title** (extracted from Name: Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.)
- **FarePerPerson**
- **CabinKnown**
- **Deck** (from Cabin)
- **TicketGroupSize**

Feature engineering significantly improves model performance.

---

## 🤖 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

---

## 📊 Results

The Random Forest model achieved the best performance with improved accuracy after feature engineering.

> Exact accuracy may vary depending on random state and feature selection.

---

## 🖥️ User Experience (UX)

A simple user interface can be added using **Streamlit** to allow users to:
- Enter passenger details
- Get real-time survival predictions

This separates **model logic** from **user interaction**, following real-world ML practices.
